# High-Resolution-Video
# 1.	Generator: Combines a linear mapping from a latent space (z) with a transformer encoder to capture temporal relationships between video frames. Uses deconvolution layers to upscale embeddings into high-resolution video frames.
# 2.	Discriminator: Processes each frame with convolutional layers.
# o	Aggregates features across frames to evaluate both spatial quality and temporal consistency. Uses an adversarial training loop with a loss function (e.g., GAN loss) to train both the generator and discriminator.

# Future Goal:	Using a more sophisticated transformer architecture (e.g., attention masking for sequence positions). Adding perceptual or temporal loss for enhanced video realism. Incorporating motion dynamics models for better temporal coherence.
